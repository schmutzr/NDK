    "## Redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter the errors induced by electromagnetic interference a certain amount of \"redundancy\" is\n",
    "introduced in the bit-stream before transmission. The receiver is then able to determind the\n",
    "error-free transmission (detection) or using more complex redundancy schemes to even correct some errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "The message to transmit is simply repeated three or more times, enabling the receiver to\n",
    "determine the correct value of each bit by applying a majority evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very crude scheme with a very bad channel-bandwidth (bitrate) efficiency.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of the parity-bit is to detect single bit errors in a bit-string (usually a byte for asynchronous serial transfers by RS-232)\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"parity\" can be defined as. Like in all protocols the sender and receiver must\n",
    "agree on the setting before a transmission can take place (either by negotiation\n",

    "\n",
    "* odd: the parity-bit is set by the sender to achieve an odd number of \"1\" bits\n",
    "\n",
    "* even: the parity-bit is set to make the number of \"1\" bits even\n",
    "\n",
    "The receiver counts the \"1\" bits (including the parity bit) and determines if\n",
    "the transmission was error-free by comparing the \"evenness\" or \"oddness\" of\n",
    "bits. Actual implementation in software does not \"count\" bits but apply a\n",
    "bitwise XOR operation accross all bits (see below).\n",
    "\n",
